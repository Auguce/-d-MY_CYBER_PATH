          <p>
            <strong>About Me</strong><br>
            Originally embarking on an academic path focused on business studies, my undergraduate journey underwent a transformative shift towards computer science, sparked by my growing fascination with cybersecurity and network protocols during my exchange program in the UK. This transition culminated in an undergraduate research project, "Key Exchange using Neural Networks," fueling my passion to pursue cybersecurity further.
          </p>
          <p>
            Currently, I am a Master's student in Computer Science specializing in Cybersecurity at the Graduate School of Arts & Sciences, Boston University. My coursework heavily emphasizes cybersecurity topics, preparing me with strong practical and theoretical foundations. I am proficient in multiple programming languages (Java, Python, C, PHP, JavaScript, SQL, Go, Swift, Solidity), security tools (Nmap, Kali Linux, Wireshark, tcpdump), platforms (Linux, Windows), and software collaboration tools (Git, GitHub). I am experienced in Linux systems administration and adept at command-line operations. Additionally, I possess skills in prompt engineering, effectively collaborating with AI-driven platforms. I am bilingual, fluent in Mandarin Chinese and English.
          </p>
          <p>
            At Boston University, I am actively engaging in various cybersecurity competitions and extracurricular activities to rapidly expand my skillset, benefiting from my adaptability and swift learning capabilities. Currently, I am seeking internship opportunities specifically targeting roles such as Security Analyst, Information Security Analyst, or Security Operations Center (SOC) Analyst to apply my knowledge in real-world scenarios. Long-term, I aspire to develop my career as a Penetration Tester or a Software Engineer focusing on automation and development of cybersecurity defense solutions, proactively combating evolving cyber threats.

      <h2>NCAE Cyber Games Experience</h2>
      <p>
        In March 2025, I represented Boston University as a team member in the <strong>NCAE Cyber Games</strong>, where our team clinched the East Overflow Regional Championship with a total score of <strong>3973 points</strong>. While our Blue Team secured <strong>1823 points</strong> for system maintenance, I independently tackled all Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges spanning <strong>Network Steganography, Cryptography, Exploitation, and Binary Exploitation</strong>. In just one month of intensive preparation, I solved 50% of the medium and hard-level CTF problems, earning <strong>925 points</strong> out of our team’s <strong>2050 CTF points</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        This experience not only showcased my rapid learning and problem-solving skills but also deepened my practical expertise with security tools such as <strong>Kali Linux</strong>. Working closely with my teammates under high-pressure competition conditions enriched my communication and collaboration skills—qualities essential for entry-level cybersecurity roles such as Security Analyst, Information Security Analyst, or SOC Analyst.
