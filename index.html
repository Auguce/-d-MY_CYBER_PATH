            <strong>About Me</strong><br>
            Originally embarking on an academic path focused on business studies, my undergraduate journey underwent a transformative shift towards computer science, sparked by my growing fascination with cybersecurity and network protocols during my exchange program in the UK. This transition culminated in an undergraduate research project, "Key Exchange using Neural Networks," fueling my passion to pursue cybersecurity further.
          </p>
          <p>
            Currently, I am a Master's student in Computer Science specializing in Cybersecurity at the Graduate School of Arts & Sciences, Boston University. My coursework heavily emphasizes cybersecurity topics, preparing me with strong practical and theoretical foundations. I am proficient in multiple programming languages (Java, Python, C, PHP, JavaScript, SQL, Go, Swift, Solidity), security tools (Nmap, Kali Linux, Wireshark, tcpdump), platforms (Linux, Windows), and software collaboration tools (Git, GitHub). I am experienced in Linux systems administration and adept at command-line operations. Additionally, I possess skills in prompt engineering, effectively collaborating with AI-driven platforms. I am bilingual, fluent in Mandarin Chinese and English.
          </p>
          <p>
            At Boston University, I am actively engaging in various cybersecurity competitions and extracurricular activities to rapidly expand my skillset, benefiting from my adaptability and swift learning capabilities. Currently, I am seeking internship opportunities specifically targeting roles such as Security Analyst, Information Security Analyst, or Security Operations Center (SOC) Analyst to apply my knowledge in real-world scenarios. Long-term, I aspire to develop my career as a Penetration Tester or a Software Engineer focusing on automation and development of cybersecurity defense solutions, proactively combating evolving cyber threats.
