            <h2>Key Project: Key Exchange using Neural Networks</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>Honours Year Computer Science Project, University of Liverpool, UK</strong><br>
                <em>(Sept 2022 - Jun 2023)</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                This project delved into the innovative Kanter-Kinzel-Kanter (K-K-K) protocol, which employs neural networks for secure key exchange. 
                Under the guidance of Professor Alexei Lisitsa, I explored the theoretical foundations of the protocol, analyzed its resilience to attacks, and developed a Python-based prototype to simulate its operation in real-world scenarios.
            </p>
            <p>
                My work included:
                <ul>
                    <li>Designing a neural network structure with defined weight update rules to implement the K-K-K protocol.</li>
                    <li>Building and testing synchronization mechanisms between communication parties (Alice and Bob).</li>
                    <li>Simulating and evaluating the protocol’s robustness against genetic algorithm-based attacks.</li>
                    <li>Analyzing how different parameters affected synchronization speed and the likelihood of successful attacks.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                Despite some limitations in fully implementing advanced attack methods within the project timeline, the research highlighted the potential of neural networks in secure communication while identifying areas for further optimization and future exploration.
