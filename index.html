                <p>
                    <strong>About Me</strong><br>
                    As a dedicated Master's student in Computer Science with a specialization in Cybersecurity at Boston University, I have charted a unique path in my academic and career journey. Initially targeting a career in business, my undergraduate studies spanned a diverse range of subjects from accounting and financial fundamentals to artificial intelligence and database management. However, during my second year and subsequent exchange in the UK, I pivoted towards computer science, embracing the challenges and rigors this field demanded.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This transition was fueled by my fascination with cybersecurity, particularly sparked by my exposure to key exchange protocols. This interest led to my undergraduate project on "Key Exchange using Neural Networks," reflecting my belief in the paramount importance of cybersecurity in our AI-driven era. Despite the steep learning curve, the sense of achievement from mastering new skills in computer science as an "outsider" has been immensely rewarding.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Long-term, I aspire to be a proficient penetration tester, staying ahead of evolving cyber threats and contributing to the development of secure digital environments. Before reaching this milestone, I seek to gain diverse work experience through internships, eager to join a dynamic team where I can both contribute and grow. I firmly believe that experiences in team collaboration will be an invaluable asset in my career journey.

            <h2>Key Project: Key Exchange using Neural Networks</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>Honours Year Computer Science Project, University of Liverpool, UK</strong><br>
                <em>(Sept 2022 - Jun 2023)</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                This project delved into the innovative Kanter-Kinzel-Kanter (K-K-K) protocol, which employs neural networks for secure key exchange. 
                Under the guidance of Professor Alexei Lisitsa, I explored the theoretical foundations of the protocol, analyzed its resilience to attacks, and developed a Python-based prototype to simulate its operation in real-world scenarios.
            </p>
            <p>
                My work included:
                <ul>
                    <li>Designing a neural network structure with defined weight update rules to implement the K-K-K protocol.</li>
                    <li>Building and testing synchronization mechanisms between communication parties (Alice and Bob).</li>
                    <li>Simulating and evaluating the protocol’s robustness against genetic algorithm-based attacks.</li>
                    <li>Analyzing how different parameters affected synchronization speed and the likelihood of successful attacks.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                Despite some limitations in fully implementing advanced attack methods within the project timeline, the research highlighted the potential of neural networks in secure communication while identifying areas for further optimization and future exploration.
